KOS
===

KOS is an unofficial development environment for the SEGA Dreamcast game console.

It was developed from scratch over the internet by a group of free software developers, and has no relation to the old Katana or WinCE development kits for the DC.


Documentation
-------------

For all documentation, please look in the *doc* directory.
Please read *at least* the main README file before trying to begin!

You will need to set up an environment variable file, build an SH4 and ARM cross-compiler, build *KOS* and optionally *kos-ports*.

An installation script, guide as well as programming tutorials may be found
in the wiki at http://dcemulation.org/?title=Development
