/** \file   ext2/fs_ext2.h
    \brief  VFS interface for an ext2 filesystem.

    This file defines the public interface to add support for the Second
    Extended Filesystem (ext2) to KOS' VFS. ext2 is one of the many filesystems
    that is natively supported by Linux, and was the main filesystem used by
    most Linux installations pretty much until the creation of the ext3
    filesystem.

    The KOS ext2 driver was designed with two purposes. First of all, this fs
    was added to provide a filesystem for use on SD cards used with the
    Dreamcast SD adapter. ext2 was chosen for this purpose for a bunch of
    reasons, but probably the biggest one was the non-patent-encumbered nature
    of ext2 and the availability of programs/drivers to read ext2 on most major
    OSes available for PCs today. The second purpose of this filesystem driver
    is to provide an alternative for fs_romdisk when swapping out disk images at
    runtime. Basically, if a disk image is useful to you, but cacheing it fully
    in memory is not important, then you could rig up a relatively simple
    interface with this filesystem driver.

    Note that there is a lower-level interface sitting underneath of this layer.
    This lower-level interface (simply called ext2fs) should not generally be
    used by any normal applications. As of this point, it is completely non
    thread-safe and the fs_ext2 layer takes extreme care to overcome those
    issues with the lower-level interface. Over time, I may fix the thread-
    safety issues in ext2fs, but that is not particularly high on my priority
    list at the moment. There shouldn't really be a reason to work directly with
    the ext2fs layer anyway, as this layer should give you everything you need
    by interfacing with the VFS in the normal fashion.

    There's one final note that I should make. Everything in fs_ext2 and ext2fs
    is licensed under the same license as the rest of KOS. None of it was
    derived from GPLed sources. Pretty much all of what's in ext2fs was written
    based on the documentation at http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ .

/** \defgroup ext2_mount_flags          Mount flags for fs_ext2

    These values are the valid flags that can be passed for the flags parameter
    to the fs_ext2_mount() function. Note that these can be combined, except for
    the read-only flag.

    Also, it is not possible to mount some filesystems as read-write. For
    instance, if the filesystem was marked as not cleanly unmounted (from Linux
    itself), the driver will fail to mount the device as read-write. Also, if
    the block device does not support writing, then the filesystem will not be
    mounted as read-write (for obvious reasons).

    These should stay synchronized with the ones in ext2fs.h.

    inode and block writes are normally postponed until they are either evicted

    be a good idea if there is a chance that the filesystem will not be
    unmounted cleanly.
