    \brief  Platform-independent image type.

    This file provides a platform-independent image type that is designed to
    hold any sort of textures or other image data. This type contains a very
    basic description of the image data (width, height, pixel format), as well
    as the image data itself.

    All of the image-loading libraries in kos-ports should provide a function
    to load the image data into one of these types.

/** \brief  Platform-indpendent image type.

    You can use this type for textures or whatever you feel it's appropriate
    for. "width" and "height" are as you would expect. "format" has a lower-half
    which is platform-independent and used to basically describe the contained
    data; the upper-half is platform-dependent and can hold anything (so AND it
    off if you only want the bottom part).

    Note that in some of the more obscure formats (like the paletted formats)
    the data interpretation may be platform dependent. Thus we also provide a
    data length field.
