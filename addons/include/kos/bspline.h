    \brief  B-Spline curve support.

    This module provides utility functions to generate b-spline curves in your
    program. It is used by passing in a set of control points to
    bspline_coeff(), and then querying for individual points using
    bspline_get_point().

    Note that this module is NOT thread-safe.

/** \brief  Calculate and set b-spline coefficients.

    This function performs the initial setup work of calculating the
    coefficients needed to generate a b-spline curve for the specified set of
    points. The calculation is based on a total of 4 points: one previous point,
    the current point, and two points that occur after the current point.

    The current point should be at pnt[0], the previous at pnt[-1], and the
    future points should be at pnt[1], and pnt[2]. I repeat: pnt[-1] must be a
    valid point for this to work properly.

    \param  pnt         The array of points used to calculate the b-spline
                        coefficients.

    for the current set of coefficients.
