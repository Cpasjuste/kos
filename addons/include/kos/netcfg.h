/** \file   kos/netcfg.h
    \brief  Network configuration interface.

    This file provides a common interface for reading and writing the network
    configuration on KOS. The interface can read from the flashrom on the
    Dreamcast or from a file (such as on a VMU or the like), and can write data
    back to a file.

    The data that is written out by this code is written in a relatively easy to
    parse text-based format.
