    \brief  Small PCX Loader.

    This module provides a few functions used for loading PCX files. These
    funcions were mainly for use on the GBA port of KallistiOS (which has been
    removed from the tree), although they can be used pretty much anywhere.
    That said, libpcx is generally more useful than these functions for use on
    the Dreamcast.

/** \brief  Load a PCX file into a buffer as paletted data.

    This function is similar to the pcx_load_flat() function, but instead of
    decoding the image into a flat buffer, it decodes the image into a paletted
    format. The image itself will be 8-bit paletted pixels, and the palette is
    in a 15-bit BGR format. The width and height of the buffer should match that
    of the image itself.

    \param  fn          The file to load.
    \param  w_out       Buffer to return the width of the image in.
    \param  h_out       Buffer to return the height of the image in.
    \param  pic_out     Buffer to store image data in. This should be width *
                        height bytes in size.
    \param  pal_out     Buffer to store the palette data in. This should be
                        allocated to hold 256 uint16_t values.
