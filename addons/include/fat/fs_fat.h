/** \file   fat/fs_fat.h
    \brief  VFS interface for a FAT filesystem.

    This file defines the public interface to add support for the FAT
    filesystem, as in common use on all kinds of systems and popularized by
    MS-DOS and Windows. This interface supports FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32, with
    both short and long names.

    Note that there is a lower-level interface sitting underneath of this layer.
    This lower-level interface (simply called fatfs) should not generally be
    used by any normal applications. As of this point, it is completely non
    thread-safe and the fs_fat layer takes extreme care to overcome those
    issues with the lower-level interface. Over time, I may fix the thread-
    safety issues in fatfs, but that is not particularly high on my priority
    list at the moment. There shouldn't really be a reason to work directly with
    the fatfs layer anyway, as this layer should give you everything you need
    by interfacing with the VFS in the normal fashion.

/** \defgroup fat_mount_flags          Mount flags for fs_fat

    These values are the valid flags that can be passed for the flags parameter
    to the fs_fat_mount() function. Note that these can be combined, except for
    the read-only flag.

    Also, it is not possible to mount some filesystems as read-write. For
    instance, if the filesystem was marked as not cleanly unmounted the driver
    will fail to mount the device as read-write. Also, if the block device does
    not support writing, then the filesystem will not be mounted as read-write
    (for obvious reasons).

    These should stay synchronized with the ones in fatfs.h.

    This function completes all pending writes on the filesystem, making sure
    all data and metadata are in a consistent state on the block device. As both
    inode and block writes are normally postponed until they are either evicted
    from the cache or the filesystem is unmounted, doing this periodically may
    be a good idea if there is a chance that the filesystem will not be
    unmounted cleanly.
